# Network Traffic Analysis

# Here is a background information on the task
Suspicious network activity has been detected coming from a user on the ANZ network.

A laptop has been flagged up on our security systems due to suspicious internet traffic, and we need you to investigate the network traffic in order to establish what the user accessed and downloaded.

Your task is to examine their network activity and gather what information you can on what images they viewed and what files they accessed.

You have been provided with a packet capture file (pcap) containing all their recent network activity. There may be a number of artifacts contained within the packet capture file, and you will be expected to identify and report as many as possible.

Note: Before you begin, please note that the relevant traffic is all in http.

# Below is also a document that details how I am expected to carry out each of these tasks.

# Tools I used to carry out this task

- Wireshark
- HxD (Hex Editor)
- Paint â€” for image annotation

#  Network Traffic Analysis Workflow
Network Traffic Analysis workflows can be approached in various ways, but the method I have observed experts use, which I've also adopted, typically follows this pattern:

- Ingest Traffic: refers to the initial step of collecting and importing network data, often through packet capture or log files, for further analysis and examination of network activity.

- Reduce Noise by Filtering: is aimed at eliminating irrelevant or extraneous data to focus on meaningful network traffic patterns.

- Analyse and Explore: involves examining and investigating network data by applying specific filters to uncover valuable insights and anomalies.

- Detect and Alert: involves identifying suspicious or significant network events by applying specific filters to network traffic data, triggering alerts or notifications for further investigation.

It is also important to note that the steps above are iterative which means we can go over the steps severally as we discover new information about our network traffic. Using the above workflow I will be carrying out this Network Traffic Analysis task as provided by ANZ.

# Ingest Traffic
I will begin by importing the traffic data into our Network Traffic Analyzer, in this case, Wireshark. ANZ has provided the Packet Capture file, which I will simply open using Wireshark.
